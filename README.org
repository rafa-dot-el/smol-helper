#+Title: Smol Helper

[[file:./helper.jpg]]

Smol helper is a small client for a small LLM model to assist on very basic
tasks, the main focus in on performance and availability.

It has 3 available modes:

- Conversational: Default mode no extra parameters required, shows a prompt for
  a conversation
- =-oneshot=: reads the whole =stdin= input before processing on the model, useful
  for completion tasks or scripts
- =-headless=: a conversational mode without a prompt, useful for scripts which
  require continuous inputs or bots.

For the conversational modes *a blank line* tells the model that it should act on
the input up to that point. This is not suitable to send code which has a lot of
blank lines in between the statements, for this =-oneshot= is recommended.

* Installation
** Go tooling from Github

#+begin_src bash
go install -v github.com/rafa-dot-el/smol-helper@latest
#+end_src


** Binaries

* Running in interactive mode
This is the default mode, it will start a conversation which will have a context.

#+begin_src bash
smol-helper
#+end_src

The conversation is split between =User= and =Helper=:

#+begin_example
User: What is Debian?

Helper: Debian is a free and open-source operating system. It is developed and
maintained by a community of volunteers who work together to provide a complete
and stable operating system. Debian is known for its simplicity and ease of use,
and is used by many individuals, organizations, and governments around the
world.

User: What is Nixos?

Helper: NixOS is a Linux distribution based on the Nix package manager. It is
designed to be simple, flexible, and secure, and is designed to be used in
production environments. NixOS is known for its focus on security and privacy,
and provides a secure and isolated environment for its users.

User: What is the Dark Brotherhood?

Helper: Dark Brotherhood is a fictional organization in the video game The Elder
Scrolls V: Skyrim. It is a group of assassins who serve the Daedric Prince Molag
Bal. The Dark Brotherhood is known for their secrecy, their use of dark magic,
and their willingness to kill anyone who threatens the stability of the game's
world.
#+end_example

* Running in headless mode
Using the flag =-headless= no other output than the server output will be printed
out. This is to be used on shell scripts and as a backend for applications.

#+begin_src bash
smol-helper -headless
#+end_src

Now your application can read from the process =stdout= and write to the process
=stdin= without worrying about formats or parsing data.

* Running in one shot mode
One shot mode is usefull for integration which don't require keeping the
context, and at the same time have bigger inputs, as in pieces of code, error
logs and general tasks which require line breaks and just one bigger context.

If using an interactive shell, type the input without worrying about line breaks
and finish it with =Ctrl + D=. If not running interactively, is possible to pipe
or input a file to the model as the following:

#+begin_src bash
cat example-docstring | smol-helper -oneshot
#+end_src

Or

#+begin_src bash
smol-helper -oneshot < example-docstring
#+end_src

It will give the following output:

#+begin_example
```py
def sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Sum two numbers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : int
        First number.
    b : int
        Second number.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The sum of the two numbers.
    """
    return a + b
```
#+end_example

The contents of the task file are the following:

#+begin_example
Given the code below, write a python docstring with the Google standard listing all parameters.


def sum(a: int, b:int) -> int:
  return a+b
#+end_example

* Build
It uses standard =Golang= tooling, to build just run
#+begin_src bash
go build -o smol-helper cmd/smol-helper/main.go
#+end_src

** Release
Releases are executed using =gorelease=:
#+begin_src bash
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean
#+end_src

* Developing
This project uses =nix= and =direnv=, just

#+begin_src bash
direnv allow
#+end_src

and

#+begin_src bash
nix develop
#+end_src

Are enough to give you a development environment.
